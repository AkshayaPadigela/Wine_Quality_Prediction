# Wine Quality Prediction Project using Multi Linear Regression

## Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the quality of wines using a multiple linear regression model. By analyzing various physicochemical features of red and white wines, weâ€™ll build a machine learning model that can estimate wine quality based on those features.

## Technology Stack:
Python (3.x)

Jupyter Notebooks (for data exploration and analysis)

Scikit-learn (for model training)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization)

## Steps Overview:

**Data Exploration**: 
Understand the dataset, check for missing values, and explore feature distributions.

**Data Preprocessing**:
Handle missing data (if any).
Normalize or standardize features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**Model Training**:
Implement a multiple linear regression model.
Train the model using the training data.

**Visualization**:
Plot the insights from model using Matplotlib with title as "Predicted Quality Against True Quality",
X axis labeled as "True Quality" and Y acxis labeled as "Prediction Quality"
